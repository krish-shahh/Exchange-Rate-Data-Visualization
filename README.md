# Exchange Rate Data Visualization

I learned that there are two types of data visualization:

- Exploratory data visualization: we create graphs for ourselves to better understand and explore data.
- Explanatory data visualization: we create graphs for others to inform, make a point, or tell a story.

Throughout, we focused on explanatory data visualization and learned the following:

- How to use information design principles (familiarity and maximizing the data-ink ratio) to create better graphs for an audience.
- About the elements of a story and how to create storytelling data visualizations using Matplotlib.
- How to create visual patterns using Gestalt principles.
- How to guide the audience's attention with pre-attentive attributes.
- How to use Matplotlib built-in styles — with a case study on the FiveThirtyEight style.

In this project, I combined these skills.

The dataset I'll use describes Euro daily exchange rates between 1999 and 2022. The euro (symbolized with €) is the official currency in most of the countries of the European Union.

If the exchange rate of the euro to the US dollar is 1.5, I get 1.5 US dollars if we pay 1.0 euro (one euro has more value than one US dollar at this exchange rate).

**Daria Chemkaeva** put together the data set and made it available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lsind18/euro-exchange-daily-rates-19992020) — the data source is the European Central Bank. Note that the dataset gets regular updates — I downloaded it on July 2022.
